# ConvoReps â€” Real-Time AI Phone Training

ConvoReps is a real-time voice simulation system for training sales reps, job seekers, and English learners via phone. It uses Twilio, OpenAI (Whisper + GPT), and ElevenLabs to carry out full conversations over the phone with natural pacing and personality switching.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Behavior

- `/voice` â€“ Handles initial Twilio voice webhook, plays greeting
- `/transcribe` â€“ File-based voice â†’ transcript â†’ GPT â†’ ElevenLabs â†’ MP3 playback
- Cold call, interview, and small talk modes supported
- Personalized AI voices with memory per session
- Voice responses currently served as MP3 files

## ðŸš§ Milestone: Real-Time Audio Pipeline

**Goal:** Replace `/transcribe` with a real-time, low-latency pipeline under 1.5s round-trip.

Must preserve:
- Mode-specific logic and voice personalities
- Session memory and switching
- Fallback to file-based audio if streaming fails
